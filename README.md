In order to run this code we had created a Linux based Virtual machine using virtual box on temporary basis.



# Python_Packet_Capture:

This is the repository which contains how to just capture any network packet by using Python programming language.
For this we have used "PCAPY" package which is present there in python programming.The operating system on which the
following code was ran is Linux.

# PCAPY Package:

Pcapy is a Python extension module that enables software written in Python to access the routines from the pcap packet capture library.

From libpcap’s documentation: “Libpcap is a system-independent interface for user-level packet capture. Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network monitoring. Applications include network statistics collection, security monitoring, network debugging, etc.”
